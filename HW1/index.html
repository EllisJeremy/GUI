                        So far, the only life we know of is right here on our planet Earth. But we’re looking.

                        The big question – Is there life beyond Earth? – comes with an ironic asterisk: we don't really
                        have a universally
                        accepted definition of life itself. That said, we might not need one. We need only detect the
                        telltale signs of life in
                        an exoplanet atmosphere, and we have a better understanding of what those look like here on
                        Earth. </p>

                        The search for life beyond Earth is really just getting started, but science has an encouraging
                        early answer: there are
                        plenty of planets in the galaxy, many with similarities to our own. But what we don’t know fills
                        volumes.

                        Observations from the ground and from space have confirmed thousands of planets beyond our solar
                        system. Our galaxy
                        likely holds at least 100 billion. But so far, we have no evidence of life beyond Earth. Is life
                        in the cosmos easily
                        begun, and commonplace? Or is it incredibly rare?

                        Antarctica, in superheated vents on the ocean floor, and they belong to branches of life that
                        split from our own

                        kill anything else. They might also be analogs for strange life on distant worlds.

                        Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars – that’s a one
                        followed by 24 zeros. Our
                        Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.

                        Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other
                        elements. Every star has
                        its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change
                        as it ages.
